# Routine
I *need* and *want* to be more accountable. And this starts today.

This repo is a self project in staying accountable. I will try to make a new file everyday to just write a routine for the next day, and what I need to do to set up for tomorrow's routine.

This is bound to get progressively tougher, and harder to track and stick to it. Anyway, watch the journey (maybe it ends somewhere?)

# Evaluation 21.08.2023
I have realized that its very tough for me to follow a routine. But I'm determined not to dropout, instead figure out what I need to do to succeed.

## What I learned
Starting a routine **directly** was a mistake; a setup for failure waiting to happen. I don't have the discipline in me to just start a full-fledged routine. I must accept that this is just Level 0. But, there was something of the routine that really stuck. **It was the what to do when I wake up + the overarching goals.** What I'm actually doing is mainly habit stacking (for the morning/evening thing). I was actually very flaky on the "what to do before I sleep" stuff - I think this means that it is **better to stack habits after the things I do**! Another learning was that I take ~1 hour to sleep just doing the things I need to do to sleep, once I have made up my mind.

## Actionables
Define a simpler routine based on habit stacking. 
1. Find what habits I do
2. Find goals I want to achieve / habits I want to do.
3. Figure out how to stack them around.
4. Iterate.

## Implementation
What are my MOST BASIC habits?
* I wake up everyday
* I sleep everyday
* I gym 6 days a week

What are my over-arching day goals?
* Sleep everyday for 8 hours
* Drink 4L of water
* Eat 50g of protein
* Eat a bowl of oats everyday

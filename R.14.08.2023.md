# Routine:

| Time | What am I going to do? | What do I need to do to succeed on this tomorrow? | Worked? | Why? |

|  |  | Keep water bottle filled, on the table outside | ✅ |  |
| 10:00 - 10:30 AM | Call Darshan | - | ❌ | Was late, because I woke up late. This overflowed into next thing and sleep was bad too. Couldn’t do next task |

## Over-arching goals

| Goal | Success/Failure | Why? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Water - 750 ml (1 bottle) x 5 | ❌ | Goal was too ambitious, reduce it |
| Protein - 50g | ❌ | No whey protein at home.(Now ordered) 
Had much lesser through dal + paneer |
| 1 Fruit | ❌ | Didn’t ask for it. |


## Learnings
1. Need to win on sleep. Catch up on sleep tomorrow.
2. Goals for water intake and protein should be realistic and achievable.
3. Planning for fruit intake in advance can help achieve the goal.
